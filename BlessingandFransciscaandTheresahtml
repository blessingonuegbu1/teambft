<p>TESTIMONIALS</p>
OPHELIA
Yaa W. means to me: a support system, a place of growth, endless opportunities and inspiration to be and to do more.  I applied to Yaa W. because, in my bid to transition into tech from a liberal arts background, I knew I had to go through an institution and I saw a Yaa W. as just what I needed. 

 

Through Yaa W. I’ve formed long-lasting friendships and built connections with other empowered ladies and amazing facilitators. I’ve been connected with great mentors and equipped with the relevant skills to standout wherever I might find myself. Now, I’m more than ready to step into the world of Technology and thrive!
